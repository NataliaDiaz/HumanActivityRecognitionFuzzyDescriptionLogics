# HumanActivityRecognitionFuzzyDescriptionLogics
My PhD project, Human Activity Modelling and Recognition with a fuzzy ontology (Validation with CAD-120 Dataset)

Experiment from article:
Handling Real-World Context Awareness, Uncertainty and Vagueness in Real-Time Human Activity Tracking and Recognition with a Fuzzy Ontology-Based Hybrid Method

This module contains most of the knowledge-driven module of the whole hybrid activity recognition system. The data-driven low level sub-activity recognition is available in https://github.com/olmin/HumanActivityRecognition
